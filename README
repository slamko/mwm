mwm - micro window manager
==========================

In a nutshell it is a fork of dwm with some personal modifications, basic patches, and with more then 30% of code base removed.  

The project intends to bring the simplest possible window manager which is, at the same time, usable out of the box.  

Dwm has really messed code base just to fit in 2000 lines of code (which they didn't manage to do)  

Dwm claims that they are naturally suckless and at the same time they include floating and monocle(wtf) layout and top bar panel  
out of the box which seems quite contraty...  

At the same time dwm misses some pretty basic functionality like autostarting applications and some basic keybindings which people  
just copy to their configs from the internet...  

==================================================================================================================================

On the other hand mwm has all of its code in a single file mwm.c which you could study and modify.  
It has only tiling layout whithout an option do add another one.  
It also brings most popular key bindings by default and uses Super button as a main key.  
And also... mwm has no top bar panel and has no config option to enable it...
